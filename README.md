# Benchmarking of Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms on Microcontrollers

This repository hosts the benchmarking framework used to evaluate the software performance of the candidates of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Project on microcontrollers.

 - `src`: benchmarking framework source code and the build scripts used to perform the experiments
 - `implementations`: implementations of the **Round 2 Candidates** gathered from public sources
 - `benchmarks`: benchmark results

# Implementations

More information on implementations can be found [here](implementations/).

# Platforms

Currently, the benchmarking is being performed on the following development boards:

 - [Arduino Uno R3 (AVR ATmega328P)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
 - [Arduino Nano Every (AVR ATmega4809)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-every)
 - [Arduino MKR Zero (ARM Cortex-M0+)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkrzero)
 - [Arduino Nano 33 BLE (ARM Cortex-M4F)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble)
 - [Digilent uC32 (PIC32MX340F512H)](https://store.digilentinc.com/uc32-arduino-programmable-pic32-microcontroller-board-limited-time/)
 - [Espressif ESP8266 (Tensilica L106)](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266)
