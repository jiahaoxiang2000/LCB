/**

 * \brief HYENA authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * HYENA is an authenticated encryption algorithm that is built around the
 * GIFT-128 block cipher.  The algorithm has a 128-bit key, a 96-bit nonce,
 * and a 128-bit authentication tag.
 *
 * This library implements both the v1 and v2 versions of HYENA from the
 * authors.  The v1 version was submitted to the second round of the
 * NIST Lightweight Cryptography Competition but was later found to have a
 * forgery attack.  The authors fixed this with v2 but it was too late to
 * submit the update for the second round.
