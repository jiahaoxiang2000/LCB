 * \brief Subterranean authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * Subterranean (technically "Subterranean 2.0") is a family of
 * algorithms built around the 257-bit Subterranean permutation:
 *
 * \li Subterranean is an authenticated encryption algorithm with a 128-bit
 * key, a 128-bit nonce, and a 128-bit tag.
 * \li Subterranean-Hash is a hash algorithm with a 256-bit output.
 *
 * The Subterranean permutation is intended for hardware implementation.
 * It is not structured for efficient software implementation.
